Ans)A software development kit (SDK) is a set of tools that provides a developer with the ability to build a custom app ,
which can be added on, or connected to, another program. SDKs allow programmers to develop apps for a specific platform.

JDK is a software development environment used for making applets and Java applications. 
The full form of JDK is Java Development Kit. Java developers can use it on Windows, macOS, Solaris, and Linux. 
JDK helps them to code and run Java programs. It is possible to install more than one JDK version on the same computer.

JRE is a piece of a software which is designed to run other software.
It contains the class libraries, loader class, and JVM. 
In simple terms, if you want to run Java program you need JRE. 
If you are not a programmer, you don’t need to install JDK, but just JRE to run Java programs.
