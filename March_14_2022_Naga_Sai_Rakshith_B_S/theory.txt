1) What is Debugging?
-> The Java Platform Debugger Architecture is a collection of APIs to debug Java code. 
-> Java Debugger Interface - defines a high-level Java language interface that developers can easily use to write remote debugger application tools. 

2) What are the default packages present in java?
-> Java compiler imports java. lang package internally by default. 
-> It provides the fundamental classes that are necessary to design a basic Java program. 

3) Can we have an else condition without if condition?
-> It is very common to have an if without an else when there is no specific activity that needs to be performed when the condition is false. 

4) Other than boolean can we use anything in if condition?
-> if ( condition ) statement; if is a Java reserved word The condition must be a boolean expression. 
-> It must evaluate to either true or false. If the condition is true, the statement is executed. 

5) Why break is imp in switch case?
-> When you switch on a value, the switch statement essentially does a goto to the label with the matching value. 
-> This means that the break is necessary to avoid passing through to the code under the next label. 

6) Understand the naming conventions in java?
-> For variables, the Java naming convention is to always start with a lowercase letter and then capitalize the first letter of every subsequent word. 
-> Variables in Java are not allowed to contain white space, so variables made from compound words are to be written with a lower camel case syntax.
