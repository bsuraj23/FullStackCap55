HTML5 allows inline MathML and SVG in text
HTML5 allows users to draw shapes such as circles, triangles, and rectangles. 
HTML5 uses web SQL databases, local storage, and application cache for storing data temporarily.
JavaScript and browser interface run in separate threads.
Shorter document type declaration. 
Shorter character encoding declaration. Uses the UTF-8 character set.
Only compatible with newer browsers, considering there are many new tags and elements which only some browsers support.

Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building 
fast and scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking 
I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time
applications that run across distributed devices.
