1) Why the output is showing false????
-> we are returning false in the line no. 36, that's why its printing false.

2)  Difference between constructor and method?
-> Constructor is used to initialize an object whereas method is used to exhibits functionality of an object.
-> Constructors are invoked implicitly whereas methods are invoked explicitly.

3) Who gives default constructor?
-> JVM [Java Virtual Machine]

4> What are the other role of JVM?
-> To manage and enhance program memory.
-> To permit java programs to run on operating system.

5) What is the difference between c and java access specifiers?
-> There are no access specifires in c, but there are four access modifiers in java that is public, private, protected, default.

6) Why only jvm gives default constructor?
-> Because the default constructor is used to provode the default values and this is done by the java compiler which is part of the JVM.

7) Why string is passed in main method?
-> Because Command line takes the input as text, so we pass String args[] as argument in main method.

8) What happens if final keyword is applied on variable, class and method?
-> If we initialize a variable with the final keyword, then we cannot modify its value. 
-> If we declare a method as final, then it cannot be overridden by any subclasses. 
->If we declare a class as final, then that class cannot be inherited or extended.

9) Is java call by reference or call by value?
-> Java uses only call by value while passing reference variables as well.
