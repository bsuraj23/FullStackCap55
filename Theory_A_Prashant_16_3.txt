1> Predefined functions in collections.
public boolean add(Element)
public boolean addAll(collection )
public boolean remove(Object element)
public int size()
public Object[] toArray()
public boolean isEmpty()
public boolean equals(Object element)

public Iterator iterator()  //( Iterator itr=list.iterator(); )
	public boolean hasNext()
	public Object next()
	public void remove()


2>underlying ds for linked list, arraylist.
LinkedList – Double Ended Queue 
ArrayList – Array


3>advantages and disadvantages of array list
Advantage: 
Dynamic in nature (size can be changed during runtime)
Has Predefined Methods for adding, removing and sorting elements.
Add any type of data into ArrayList.
	Retrieval is faster in ArrayList.
Disadvantages:
If a data entry is added to or removed from an array-based list, data needs to be shifted to update the list.
ArrayList don’t work on primitive values.


4>What are iterators and cursors.
Iterator- Iterator is an object that can be used to loop through collections 
		methods 
hasNext() ,next() , remove()
Cursor- A Java Cursor is an Iterator, which is used to iterate or traverse or 
retrieve a Collection or Stream object’s elements one by one.
Type of Cursor –
Iterator, Enumeration, ListIterator


5>List down the security breaches than can happen in front end backend.

6.	Vulnerable and Outdated Components
7.	Identification and Authentication Failures
8.	Software and Data Integrity Failures

6>IndexOutOfBoundsException and ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is same?
IndexOutOfBoundsException: Thrown to indicate that an index of some sort (such as to an array, to a string, or to a vector) is out of range.
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Thrown to indicate that an array has been accessed with an illegal index. The index is either negative or greater than or equal to the size of the array.


7>can catch be written without try?
No, “Catch” has to written for a “Try”.


8>can try be written without catch block?
 Yes, we can have “try” without “catch” block by using “finally” block.
we cannot write only “try” block without “catch” or a “finally” blocks.


9>can finally be return without try catch?
We cannot have a “finally” without a “try”, “Catch” is optional.
