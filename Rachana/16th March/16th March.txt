1)Predifined functions in collection
-->EXISTS, COUNT, LIMIT, FIRST, LAST, PRIOR, NEXT, EXTEND, TRIM, and DELETE

2)Underlying ds for linked list,arraylist
-->Both ArrayList and LinkedList are two different implementations of the List interface. ArrayList is a resizable-array implementation, 
whereas LinkedList is a Doubly-linked list implementation of the List interface.
An ArrayList’s capacity at least as large as the list size, and it grows automatically as more elements are added to it. 
On the other hand, a LinkedList’s capacity is exactly equal to the list size, and we cannot specify the capacity during the list initialization.

3)Advantages and disadvatages of array list
advantages:
>It is not synchronized so it is fast.
>It works fast when we have to fetch or get the elements fron the list.
>It maintains insertion order, means any element by default will be added in the end of arraylist.
>There can be duplicates in the arraylist.
disadvantages:
>Never used Arraylist when you have to do lot of insertion and deletion as this will force arraylist to adjust the elements present in the list instead used linkedlist.
>When you want to add elements in the last or first and the arraylist soze is 0, in this case u can use linkedlist to add specifically on top and bottom of list.
>You can't maintain uniqueness.
>Arraylist don't work on primitive values.

4)What are iterators and cursors
> an iterator allows iteration of a container with no knowledge of the container itself. 
A cursor, on the other hand, allows iteration of a container as well but has implementation details specific to the container type, so it does keep a reference to the container.

5)What are the 10 owasp?
#1: Injection flaws
#2: Broken Authentication
#3: Cross Site Scripting
#4: Insecure Direct Object References
#5: Security misconfiguration
#6: Sensitive data exposure
#7: Missing function level access control
#8: Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
#9: Using components with known vulnerabilities
#10: Unvalidated redirects and forwards

6)IndexoutofboundException and arrayIndexOutofboundexception is same?
>IndexOutOfBoundsException :
       Thrown to indicate that an index of some sort (such as to an array, to a string, or to a vector) is out of range.

>ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 
       Thrown to indicate that an array has been accessed with an illegal index. The index is either negative or greater than or equal to the size of the array.

7)difference b/w comparable and comparator
>Comparable provides a single sorting sequence. In other words, we can sort the collection on the basis of a single element such as id, name, and price. The Comparator provides multiple sorting sequences. In other words, 
we can sort the collection on the basis of multiple elements such as id, name, and price etc.

8)can catch be return without try in java?
>Yes, we can have try without catch block by using finally block
