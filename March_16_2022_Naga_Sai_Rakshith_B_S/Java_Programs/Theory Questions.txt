1) What are the predifined functions in collection in java?
-> Predefined methods in Java are the ones that the Java class libraries already define.
-> Such as max(), min(), sqrt(), etc.

2) What are the underlying ds for linked list arraylist in java?
-> ArrayList: 
	~> ArrayList is a resizeable array in java.
	~> The Values are stored in the contigous location.
	~> The initial capacity of ArrayList is 10, as more data is added the capacity increases.
-> LinkedList:
	~> The Values are stored in the non-contigous location.
	~> The values in LinkedList are stored in the form of nodes.
	~> Each node contains data and pointer.
	~> Pointer value stores the location to the next node.

3) what are the advantages and disadvatages of array list?
-> Advantages:
	~> ArrayList is variable length.
	~> Add any type of data into ArrayList.
	~> Retrieval is faster in ArrayList
	~> Traverse in both directions.
	~> Insert and remove elements also at particular position of ArrayList.
	~> ArrayList allows multiple null values.
	~> ArrayList allows to add duplicate elements.
	~> ArrayList has many methods to manipulate stored objects.
-> Disadvantages:
	~> If a data entry is added to or removed from an array-based list, data needs to be shifted to update the list.

4) What are iterators?
-> Iterator allows iteration of a container with no knowledge of the container itself.

5) What are the 10 owasp?
-> Broken Access Control
-> Cryptographic Failures
-> Injection
-> Insecure Design
-> Security Misconfiguration
-> Vulnerable and Outdated components
-> Identifications and Authentication Failures
-> Software and Data Integrity Failures
-> Security Logging and Monitering Failures
-> Server-Side Request Forgery


6) Can catch be return without try in java?
-> Yes, we can use try with finally.

7) Can we use finally without try catch in Java?
-> A finally block must be associated with a try block, you cannot use finally without a try block. 

9) Diffarence b/w comparable and comparator in java?
->Comparable
	~> Comparable provides a single sorting sequence. 
	~> Comparable affects the original class.
	~> Comparable provides compareTo() method to sort elements.
	~> Comparable is present in java.lang package.
	~> We can sort the list elements of Comparable type by Collections.sort(List) method.
->Comparator
	~> The Comparator provides multiple sorting sequences.
	~> Comparator doesn't affect the original class.
	~> Comparator provides compare() method to sort elements.
	~> A Comparator is present in the java.util package.
	~> We can sort the list elements of Comparator type by Collections.sort(List, Comparator) method.
