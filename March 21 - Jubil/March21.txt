5. what is cookie?

Cookies are text files with small pieces of data — like a username and password — that are used to identify your computer as you use a computer network. Specific cookies known as HTTP cookies are used to identify specific users and improve your web browsing experience.

When the cookie is exchanged between your computer and the network server, the server reads the ID and knows what information to specifically serve to you.



6. If JavaScript can do frontend then why react and angular ?

React is one of the most widely used libraries for front-end development. React has become the first choice for frontend because it gives developers the ability to work with a virtual browser (more friendly than the real browser).


So the creators of Angular made a framework that is based on typescript, which can generate HTML, CSS and javascript code with the help of transpires, for the purpose of generating a workable package that can be understood by a browser. That's why Angular is considered a frontend framework.



7. Understand What is react and angular ?

Angular is a Google-developed and maintained web framework that was first released in 2010 under the name AngularJS. It quickly became one of the most popular web frameworks at the time. This was owing to capabilities like two-way data binding and dependency injection, as well as the fact that it was supported by a tech giant.

React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library[3] for building user interfaces based on UI components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies.[4][5][6] React can be used as a base in the development of single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js. However, React is only concerned with state management and rendering that state to the DOM, so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side functionality.
