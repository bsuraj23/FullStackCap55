1.Why only ‘ Strings ’ is accepted in “ public static void main(Strings args[]) ” ?
Here we are defining a String array to pass arguments at command line. args is the variable name of the String array.

2.Why is there a false in this code….
Boolean is given as a method type so no matter what parameters we will send it will should return it as boolean type. 
Return type is given that is the reason why the output shows false.

3.Diff btw C a.s and JAVA a.s
There is no access modifiers in c
but there is a.s in java

4.What is the difference Between Constructor and Method ?
Constructor is used to initialize an object whereas method is used to exhibits functionality of an object.
Constructors are invoked implicitly whereas methods are invoked explicitly.
Constructor does not return any value where the method may/may not return a value.

5.Responsibilities of JVM
Role of JVM :
•To permit Java programs to run on operating systems and any device.
•To manage and enhance program memory.

Functions performed by JVM:
•Verifies code
•Executes code
•Provides runtime environment
•Loads code

6.Who gives Default Constructor ?
JVM gives the default constructor

7.Why JVM gives Default Constructor
The Java compiler provides a default constructor if you don't have any constructor in a class. The method is not provided by the compiler in any case. The constructor name must be same as the class name.

8.Does JAVA follow Pass by Value or Pass by Reference ?
Java uses only pass by value. It creates a copy of references and pass them as value to the methods.

9.What happens when Final keyword is applied on Variable, Class and Method
If we initialize a variable with the final keyword, then we cannot modify its value.
When we apply the final keyword to a class, then that class cannot be subclassed.
When we apply it to a method, then that method cannot be overridden by any subclasses.
