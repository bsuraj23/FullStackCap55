1) What are the predifined functions in collection in java?
Predefined methods are already defined by Java class libraries. 
They can be called and used anywhere in our program without defining them. 
Eg : sqrt(), print()
		

2)what are the underlying datastructure for linkedlist ,arraylist in java?
ArrayList:
ArrayList is a resizable array implementation in java.
The backing data structure of ArrayList is an array of Object class.
When creating an ArrayList you can provide initial capacity then the array is 
declared with the given capacity. The default capacity value is 10.
LinkedList:
Linked List is a linear data structure. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are 
not stored at the contiguous location, the elements are linked using pointers as shown below.
In Java, LinkedList can be represented as a class and a Node as a separate class


3)What are the advantages and disadvatages of array list?
Advantages:
ArrayList is variable length.
Add any type of data into ArrayList.
Traverse in both directions.
Insert and remove elements also at particular position of ArrayList.
ArrayList allows multiple null values.
ArrayList allows to add duplicate elements.
ArrayList has many methods to manipulate stored objects.
Retrieval is faster in ArrayList
Disadvantages:
If a data entry is added to or removed from an array-based list, data needs to be shifted to update the list.


4) What are iterators and cursors?
Iterators:
An Iterator is an object that can be used to loop through collections, like ArrayList and HashSet. 
It is called an "iterator" because "iterating" is the technical term for looping. To use an Iterator, you must import it from the java. util package.
Cursors:
A Java Cursor is an Iterator, which is used to iterate or traverse or retrieve a Collection or Stream object's elements one by one.


5)what are the 10 owasp?
Injection
Broken Authentication
Sensitive Data Exposure
XML External Entities (XXE)
Broken Access Control
Security Misconfiguration
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Insecure Deserialization
Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
Insufficient Logging and Monitoring


6)Can catch be return without try in java?
Yes, we can have try without catch block by using finally block. 


7)Can try be return catch in java?
Whenever try-block executes successfully, then it can always return value from end of method. 
If any exception is raised from try-block then it get caught in the corresponding catch-block and catch-block can also return value


8)Can we use finally without try catch in Java?
A finally block must be associated with a try block, you cannot use finally without a try block. 
You should place those statements in this block that must be executed always


9)Diffarence between comparable and comparator in java?
Comparable:
Comparable provides a single sorting sequence. 
Comparable affects the original class, i.e., the actual class is modified.
Comparable provides compareTo() method to sort elements.
Comparable is present in java.lang package.	
We can sort the list elements of Comparable type by Collections.sort(List) method.
Comparator:
Comparator provides multiple sorting sequences. In other words, we can sort the collection on the basis of multiple elements such as id, name, and price etc.
Comparator doesn't affect the original class, i.e., the actual class is not modified.
Comparator provides compare() method to sort elements.
Comparator is present in the java.util package.
We can sort the list elements of Comparator type by Collections.sort(List, Comparator) method.
