1.What is Debugging?
Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing any issues in the source code of a program. 
Modern IDEs like Eclipse provide debugging tools that make it easier for developers to walk through their code interactively and inspect it to spot and resolve any issues.

2.What are the default packages present in java?
java.lang package


3.Can we have an else condition without if condition?
This error means that Java is unable to find an if statement associated to your else statement.
Else statements do not work unless they are associated with an if statement.


4.why break is important in switch case?
The case statements in a switch statements are simply labels. 
When you switch on a value, the switch statement essentially does a goto to the label with the matching value.
This means that the break is necessary to avoid passing through to the code under the next label.


5.Understand the naming conventions in java.
Class :-
It should start with the uppercase letter.
It should be a noun such as Color, Button, System, Thread, etc.
Use appropriate words, instead of acronyms.
Example :
public class Employee
{
//code snippet
}

Interface :-
It should start with the uppercase letter.
It should be an adjective such as Runnable, Remote, ActionListener.
Use appropriate words, instead of acronyms.	
Example :
interface Printable
{
//code snippet
}

Method :-
It should start with lowercase letter.
It should be a verb such as main(), print(), println().
If the name contains multiple words, start it with a lowercase letter followed by an uppercase letter such as actionPerformed().	
Example :
class Employee
{
// method
void draw()
{
//code snippet
}
}

Variable:-
It should start with a lowercase letter such as id, name.
It should not start with the special characters like & (ampersand), $ (dollar), _ (underscore).
If the name contains multiple words, start it with the lowercase letter followed by an uppercase letter such as firstName, lastName.
Avoid using one-character variables such as x, y, z.	
Example :
class Employee
{
// variable
int id;
//code snippet
}

Package :-
It should be a lowercase letter such as java, lang.
If the name contains multiple words, it should be separated by dots (.) such as java.util, java.lang.
Example :
package com.javatpoint;
class Employee
{
//code snippet
}

Constant :-	
It should be in uppercase letters such as RED, YELLOW.
If the name contains multiple words, it should be separated by an underscore(_) such as MAX_PRIORITY.
It may contain digits but not as the first letter.	
Example :
class Employee
{
//constant
static final int MIN_AGE = 18;
//code snippet
}
